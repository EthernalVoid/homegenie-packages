## How to bundle an HomeGenie package

A package can consist of a folder containing one or more Automation Program, Widget and MIG Interface.
In the package folder also a **README.md** file and a **package.json** file must be included.

The **README.md** is a *markdown* formatted file containing a detailed description with usage instructions for the package.

The **package.json** file is a *JSON* formatted file containing the list of files that will be installed.

### packages.json file format

The following is an example **package.json** file:

        "version": "v1.0",
        "title": "Fibaro RGBW",
        "description": "Adds ZWave Fibaro RGBWM-441 control capability to HomeGenie",
